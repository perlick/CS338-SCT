# CS338-SCT
Secure Contact Tracer (SCT) is my final project for CS338 Graphical User Interfaces. It is a mobile-first web app that provides a community with exposure risk information without compromising privacy.

## Installation
To install and run this app locally, First clone this repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/perlick/CS338-SCT.git`. The rest of the instructions assume you are using Python3 and have [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) installed. Now, create a virtual environment for the projects with the command `python3 -m venv venv` and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## Starting the server
To start the server, run `python3 main.py` from the command line in the base directory of the project. To visit the site, visit the URL provided by the output of the previous command.
